## Education

- **MASt in Applied Mathematics**, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom

  October 2017 - June 2018. The course is often referred to as the *Part III of the Mathematical Tripos*. Distinction. E. M. Burnett Prize.

- **BSc (Hons) Theoretical Physics**, University College London (UCL), United Kingdom

  September 2014 - June 2017. First class degree (1:1), Dean's list (top 5% in the Faculty of Mathematical & Physical Sciences).

## Experience

  - **Data Analyst at *Bridges for Enterprise*** October 2018 - ongoing
    Bridges for Enterprise is an international non-profit that focuses on empowering
    social entrepreneurs. I work with BfE to create a web application that can
    automatically match our clients with potential investors, based on a natural
    language processing algorithm of company descriptions.

  - **UCL Year 8 Coding Summer School 2017**. July 2017 - August 2017

    Together with my team in the educational charity *Hacking Education*, we ran a highly successful programming summer school in collaboration with UCL. Over three days kids from underprivileged areas in London are invited to UCL to learn how to code, and work on several projects. My role was to construct the teaching curriculum, as well as design the programming projects (the result of which you can find <a href="https://codingsummerschool.github.io/codingsummerschool/">here</a>).

  - **Co-founder of educational charity *Hacking Education***. June 2016 - ongoing.

    Go4Code is a UCL-funded organization that specializes in educational outreach in programming for kids from geographically underprivileged areas. With my partner and a team of student volunteers we run weekly a program in a number of schools in London. We also regularly hold one-day workshops and summer-schools in collaboration with the Widening Participation office at UCL. As a co-founder of *Hacking Education* I've successfully:
    - Designed, wrote and taught an introductory course in Python programming.
    - Supervised and coordinated the teaching in the workshops across the schools.


  - **Chair of the organizing committee of the *Conference for Physics and Astronomy Students (CAPS 2017)***. August 2016 - July 2017

    CAPS is annual student-run event organized in collaboration with the *Institute of Physics*, and is one of the largest of its kind in the UK. As chair I managed a team of fifteen to realize our vision of the conference. My main role was to act as the leader and coordinator between the sponsorship, publicity and project wings of our team, but I also dealt heavily with the logistics and the planning of the conference. Due to the pressures of the role I further developed my time-management skills, as well my leadership abilities. The event was highly successful and received a lot of positive feedback from its attendees.

  - **Vice-President of the *UCL Physics Society***, April 2015 - April 2016

    As part of my work in the society I organized a number of successful events, ranging from organizing academic events like public guest lectures, and various social events. During my time in this role I gained valuable skills in both leadership, logistics and public speaking.

  - **Founder of the *Joint Undergraduate Physics Research Conference***. October 2015 - January 2016

    In collaboration with the Imperial College PhySoc, my society planned a very successful undergraduate research conference, which brought together over a 150 attendees, including both members of academia and students. The conference was held for a second time in 2017, and is set to run again next year.

  - **App-developer for Musitude**, August 2015 - September 2015

    Developed a prototype Android application showcasing the core concept of the idea behind Musitude. With the help of my app the start-up managed to secure investment funding for 2016.

  - **Web-programmer at HalalGems**, July 2015 - September 2015

    A summer internship in which my job consisted mostly of web-server programming. During my time in the company I learned the Ruby programming language, as well as the web-application framework Ruby on Rails, from scratch. I developed a new section of their server back-end, meant for their restaurant-owner clientele. I gained valuable experience in server-programming, database management, and web-security, as well as website and mobile design.

## Internships

- **Summer internship**, *Seoul National University*. July 2017 - September 2017

  *Simulation of Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy within Nitrogen-Vacancy centers in Diamonds*

  Nitrogen-Vacancy centers possess the unique property of having a triplet ground-state, as well as a simple Triplet-0 initialization procedure. This makes the system highly attractive as a qubit candidate. My work consisted of building simulations in MATLAB and Mathematica of electron spin resonance in the NV-center.

  - Developed a fully-featured and flexible simulation of ESR on the NV-center ground-state.
  - Made the project open-source and available for public use. You can find it <a target="\_blank" href="https://github.com/lukastk/nv-centre-spectrum-simulator">here</a>.


- **Part-time research assistant**, *University College London*. January 2017 - March 2017

  Developer for the ab initio electron scattering simulation software Quantemol-N

  Currently I work part time as a developer for the UCL-based Quantemol Ltd. My role is to extend the Quantemol-N software, used for ab initio electron-molecule scattering calculations.
  - My role is to enhance the speed and the accuracy of the software by creating interfaces with other quantum chemistry packages like MolPro and Gaussian.
  - Writing object-oriented code in Java.


- **Summer internship**, *Technische Universität Berlin (TU Berlin)*. June 2016 - September 2016

  *Mathematical modeling and data-vizualisation of disease spreading across networks*

  The government organisation DAAD funded my internship in the *Nonlinear Dynamics and Control* group, led by Dr. Philipp Hövel, at TU Berlin. The research was in the field of network theory, applied specifically to epidemics, working on various datasets provided by the German government.

  - Collaborated within a team of three to produce an analysis of the dynamics of the German cattle-trade network, to explore avenues of disease spread prevention.
  - Wrote fast and efficient programs in C++ to simulate epidemic dynamics on large-scale networks. Find the repository <a target="\_blank" href="https://github.com/lukastk/epidemic_simulator">here</a>.
  - Created visualisations of the dynamics of the epidemics of complex networks using d3.js and graph_tool.


- **Part-time research assistant**, *University College London*. January 2016 - March 2016

  *Project to simulate a calorimetric device for Proton Therapy*

  I was working with Prof Ruben Saakyan and Dr Simon Jolly in the High-Energy Particle physics group at UCL. The aim of the project was to build a calorimetric device specifically designed for Proton therapy against cancer.
  - Replicated the geometry of the proton beam at the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre, to simulate the experimental conditions of the tests done on the prototype calorimeter.
  - Built the simulation in C++, using the Geant4 and ROOT libraries.
